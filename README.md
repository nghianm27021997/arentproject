### "npm run dev" to run project

The steps that I took while doing the test included:
 1) Install scss, create directory trees similar to the content on the website to facilitate maintenance and search, including:
    + folder "src/assets" to store images
    + folder "src/components" contains components
    + directory "src/constant" contains constant variables
    + file "_variable.scss" contains common variables like "color code, distance ..."

 2) After completing step 1, I read the documentation to be able to create as many reusable components as possible, for example: chart, button...

 3) I proceed to build the layout of the web pages from the components that I created in step 2, create scroll to top button.

 4) In the process of creating screens, I use additional libraries to enhance the user experience such as: "frame-motion" library, hover or active effects

 In summary during the coding process, I tried to be as optimized as possible: clean code, line spacing, separate mockup data from components, use common variables, use "map" function to avoid code duplication, fix warnings on local and on the browser's F12.
